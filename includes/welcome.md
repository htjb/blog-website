# Welcome!

I am currently a Junior Kavli Fellow at the Kavli Institute for Cosmology at the University of Cambridge and a Post-Doctoral Research Associate at St Edmunds College. My research focuses on developing novel Bayesian analysis tools and machine learning algorithms for various cosmological studies.
