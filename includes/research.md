# Research

My research focuses on the development of machine learning enhanced inference pipelines for 21-cm cosmology. Researchers in this field are aiming to probe the previously unobserved period between the formation of the well observed Cosmic Microwave Background and the present Epoch of the Galaxies using the 21-cm line from neutral hydrogen. This line is emitted when the spin of the electron in the hydrogen atom spontaneously flips from being aligned to anti-aligned with the spin of the proton. 

You can take a look at a research seminar I recently gave in Cambridge [here](https://github.com/htjb/Talks/blob/master/Talks/Research-Seminar-UoC-2025/Research-seminar-bevins.pdf). 

We quantify the relative number of hydrogen atoms in each spin state using a statistical temperature known as the spin temperature. At different epochs in cosmic history the spin temperature is driven by different processes. In the absence of any other physics the relative number of atoms in each state is driven by interactions between the hydrogen and CMB photons with a wavelength of 21-cm. However, during the dark ages between the formation of the CMB and the first stars collisions between different hydrogen atoms start to cause transitions from one state to the other coupling the spin temperature to the kinetic temperature of the gas which is cooling quicker than the CMB due to adiabatic expansion. Eventually collisions become inefficient and the spin temperature moves back towards the CMB. When the first stars and galaxies form radiation from them couples the spin temperature back to the gas via a process called Wouthuysen-Field effect. Eventually the gas and coupled spin temperature are heated back up towards and possibly above the CMB by X-ray emission from objects like X-ray binaries and black holes. UV radiation from stars and galaxies then strips the neutral hydrogen of their electrons and the signal disappears.

We measure the spin temperature relative to the CMB and redshifted in to the radio band (10 - 250 MHz) on Earth either as a sky-averaged measurement (shown below) or as spatial fluctuations through a power spectrum or tomography. By observing at different frequencies we probe different epochs because the signal is emitted at a fixed frequency and a detection would help us understand the nature of dark matter and dark energy, the properties of the first stars and galaxies and the expansion rate of the universe.

However, there are several data analysis challenges that need to be overcome if researchers want to make a confident detection of the 21-cm signal. The signal is expected to have a magnitude of around 200 mK, however our radio telescopes are also sensitive to foreground synchrotron and free-free emission from our own and other galaxies which can be around 5 orders of magnitude brighter than the signal. Furthermore, out instruments pick up human made radio signals like FM radio between 80-100 MHz, walkie-talkies and airplane communications. Observations are also impacted by changing environmental conditions and diffraction and attenuation by the ionosphere. In fact the ionosphere completely prevents observations at the lower band of interest around 10-40 MHz corresponding to the dark ages and there are several proposals to go to the moon to observe in this band. Finally, our instruments do not see the whole sky with the same weighting and in order to extract the signal from the observations it has to be amplified in a receiver chain which introduces noise and non-trivial modulations that have to be calibrated for.

The immense challenges presented by 21-cm cosmology require detailed forward models of the observations, careful calibration and Bayesian inference to properly understand the uncertainties and degeneracies in our modelling. However, forward models like this can be extremely computationally expensive, and it is often not possible to perform inference directly on them because they have to be called 100,000s to millions of times.

My work aims to address these challenges with novel machine learning enhanced inference pipelines. I have worked on [neural network surrogates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04336) for computationally expensive physical models of the 21-cm signal, [traditional calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14023) algorithms and novel [machine learning calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16791) algorithms, [foreground modelling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14970), post-processing of constraints in [marginal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.12841) parameter spaces and calibration of Bayesian [tension metrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15478) with machine learning. My work led to some of the [first constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00464) on high redshift galaxies at z=15-25 and the [first joint analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03298) of sky-averaged 21-cm observations and power spectrum observations. More recently with collaborators I have worked on multi-wavelength constraints using [JWST](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21687), [Planck and Lyman line observables](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09725), as well as [Radio and X-ray background](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08095) limits. I've also worked on constraints on [cosmic strings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08828), forecasts for constraints on [PopIII IMF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18098) with REACH and the SKA and novel inference pipelines for [gravitational waves](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17663). I am currently working on instrument modelling with ML, forecasts for dark ages observations and constraining star formation in early galaxy populations with JWST. 

I am part of the [REACH](https://www.reachtelescope.org/) collaboration which aims to observe the sky-averaged 21-cm signal from the Karoo in South Africa and the [CosmoCube](https://www.cosmocube.net/) initiative which aims to observe the dark ages signal from lunar orbit.
