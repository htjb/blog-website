# About

I am a Kavli Junior Fellow at the Kavli Institute for Cosmology and Cavendish Astrophysics at the University of Cambridge. Prior to this I was PhD student in Cambridge working on data analysis for 21-cm Cosmology with Professors Eloy de Lera Acedo, Anastasia Fialkov and Will Handley. I did my undergraduate in Manchester in Physics and Astrophysics and worked on simulations of the radio background for my masters project. 

When I'm not thinking about astrophysics I'm can be found coding, running around Cambridge or off hiking.

I enjoy exploring different programming languages and frameworks, and I am always looking for new things to play with. I learn best when I am doing, and you can see what I have been up to on [github](https://github.com/htjb).

I've run a few marathons, half marathons and 10k races including London Marathon in 2025, York Marathon in 2024 and a few races in Cambridge. I am running Manchester Marathon in 2026 and I am hoping to have a go at UTMB's Snowdonia 25k in 2027 with a marathon the following autumn.
